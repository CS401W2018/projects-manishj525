         <h1>1. What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h1>
         <p><li>Block elements take up the full width and push everything below them to a new line, like a paragraph.</li></p>
         <p><li></li>Inline elements only take up the space they need and stay within the line, like a word in a sentence.</p>
         <h1>2. What is normal flow in HTML?</h1>
         <div class="clear"></div>
         <p>This is the default way elements are arranged on the page. Block elements stack on top of each other, while inline elements stay next to each other in a line.</p>
         <h1>3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h1>
         <p>Float pushes an element to the left or right, allowing other elements like text to wrap around it. You need to "clear" the float to prevent it from affecting other parts of the layout.</p>
         <h1>4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h1>
         <p><li>Relative: Moves an element from where it would normally be, slightly up, down, left, or right.</li></p>
         <p><li>Absolute: Puts an element in a specific place, not following normal flow.</li></p>
         <p><li>Fixed: Keeps an element in the same spot on the screen, even when scrolling.</li></p>
         <h1>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h1>
         <p>For mobile, create big, easy-to-tap buttons that fit the screen width, with space around them so they are not too close together. This makes it comfortable for users to navigate.</p>
         <h1>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h1>
