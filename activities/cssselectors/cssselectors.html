        <h2>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p id="first">Since an ID is unique to one element on a webpage, it cannot be shared by two elements. You can style it in CSS by using the # symbol (#myId, for example) followed by the ID name.</p>
        <p>Shared styles between elements on a webpage are possible when a class is applied to multiple elements.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p>An inline element called a SPAN is used to group short text passages together without generating a line break.</p>
        <p>Larger content sections are connected together using a DIV, a block-level element that begins on a new line.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>DIV: A general container that lacks a defined purpose.</p>
        <p>HEADER: Provides navigation or introduction content.</p>
        <p>MAIN: Identifies the page's primary material.</p>
        <p>FOOTER: Includes copyright information and other footer elements.</p>
        <h2>What are different ways to select a color?</h2>
        <p>select color from color grid or simply type color name</select></p>
