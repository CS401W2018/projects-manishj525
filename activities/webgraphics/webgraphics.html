    <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
    <p>JPEG is great for detailed photos like landscapes or portraits with many colors. It compresses well but loses some quality.</p>

    <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
    <p>GIF works well for simple graphics, animations, or images with few colors. It supports transparency and animation.</p>

    <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
    <p>PNG keeps all image details without losing quality and supports transparent backgrounds. It's perfect for logos or images needing sharp edges.</p>

    <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
    <p>Use photo editing software like Photoshop or free online tools (e.g., Canva) to adjust the size before uploading it to your site.</p>

    <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of CSS?</h2>
    <p>Resizing with software reduces file size, making pages load faster. CSS only changes display size but doesnâ€™t reduce file size, so the image still takes longer to load.</p>
