    <h1>I'll be sharing about my mission story</h1>
    <h2>My Name is Manish Jurial and I'm from India New Delhi</h2>
    <p>
        Here's a revised version of your text:
        
        Hello everyone, my name is Manish, and I am from New Delhi, India. I was born and raised in New Delhi. 
        When I was 19, I decided to serve a mission for my church and was called to serve in the India Bangalore Mission. 
        During my mission, I had many experiences that strengthened my testimony.
        <p>One experience in particular has always stood out to me and reminds me of our Heavenly Father's promises to His children that if we have faith, both in our lives and our families, He will bless us.</p>
        <p>There was a family I taught about the Plan of Salvation. <mark>With their faith and trust in the Lord,</mark> they believed in the teachings and eventually converted to the gospel.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Why I'm sharing beacuse it help me to understand god plan for us.</h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>it teaches that we all are children of god and if we have faith in him, will guide us in life.</li>
        <li>this experience teach me that god is mindfull to his children.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>&gt; An abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives. The <strong>Lighthouse of the Lord.&quot;</blockquote>
